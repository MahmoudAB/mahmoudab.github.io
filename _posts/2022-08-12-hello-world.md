Hello World! Welcome to my blog! In this blog I will document the things I learn in my software development journey.

Thanks for taking the time to explore and read this article. I would like to say that I am big proponent of learning, and I want to congratulate you in seeking knowledge, here's an interesting and cool quote on learning:

> “The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.”
― Dr. Seuss

I encourage you to apply the concepts you read in this blog, the real experience is in doing and not reading. Another cool quote:

> “Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.”

– Benjamin Franklin

I hope you get a thing or two from this blog, feel free to reach out to me on my socials for any feedback, and don't forget to keep on learning!

until next time!

- Mahmoud Abdel Basset
