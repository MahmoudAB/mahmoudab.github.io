#### To get started you must have some backgroud knowledge in javascript

## **Step 1**: [Install nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## **Step 2**: [We will be using mongo, make sure you have that installed](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)

## **Step 3**: Lets get started with setting up your node project

1. Open a terminal and navigate to a dir of your choice
1. Create a new dir for the project
    ```
    mkdir inventory-chest
    ```

1. Run the follwing command 
    ```
    npm init
    ```
   - Follow the prompts:
     - Enter your name and description
     - You can leave the rest as default for now 
     - Voila you should be all set to start coding and adding dependencies 
    
## **Step 4**: Lets add all the dependencies we need

 1. navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the packages we need:
    ```
    npm i express body-parser express mongo mongoose nodemon
    ```

2. Now we will add specific dependencies only for dev puposes, is is doone by adding  __--save-dev__ 
   ```
   npm i --save-dev babel-cli -babel-preset-env babel-preset-stage0
   ```

3. Now lets change our startup script in the package.json file

    - in your file you will see:
    ```
    "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
       },
    ```
    - change it to :
    ```
    "scripts": {
        "start": "nodemon ./index.js --exec babel-node -e js"
    }
    ```

## **Step 5**: Now lets start coding!

1. create new **index.js** file 

2. In the index.js file we will start by importing express

    ```
    import express from 'express';
    ```
3. We then declare two const
    ```
    const app = express();
    const PORT = 4000;
    ```

4. lets add a get enpoind
    ```
    app.get('/', (req, res) =>
        res.send('Hello, welcome to your chest!')
    );
    ```
5. Now lets start our sever and log that we are listening on port 4000:
    ```
    app.listen(PORT, () => 
        console.log(`Your server is sunning on port ${PORT}`)
    );
    ```
## **Step 6**: Lets test run our application!
1. To run the project, navigate to the main project dir and run the following command:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
2. You can use your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4000
3. Or you can downlaod and test your application using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) 

    You should see our message: **Hello, welcome to your chest!**

## **Step 7**: Now lets add routes 

1. Before we do that, lets give a structure to our project:
    
    - In the main project dir, let add a new **src** dir

      ```
       mkdir src
      ```
    - inside src dir we will add 3 more dirs (controllers, models, routes)
      ```
      mkdir {controllers,models,routes}
      ```
